# zigy-Task
In this Task i have created routes for adding a post and then delete a post and add a review 
Connected to mongoDB database in the backend locally to mongo db Compass 
It is an app where we can add posts using a form that will be displayed on the main page
same with delete route
we can add a review as well on the same page for that particular post'.
